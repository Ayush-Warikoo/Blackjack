# Blackjack

## Description
Recreated commonly played casino game blackjack in python with a tutorial feature, automated computer-player as the house and betting capabilities.
To play, it requires python 3.0 or higher and no additional installation. 

## How to Play
The objective of the game is for the values of your cards to total to as close as 21 as possible, without going over. 
You will first get two cards and then have the option to pick another card and repeat this process until you decide to stay or go over 21.
Then, if your total is closer to 21 than the house, you win. If you have the same value, the money is split and if you are farther than the house or over 21, you lose. 
All cards are equal to their numeric value, all face cards are equal to 10 and aces allow you to choose a value of 1 or 11, depending on what you need. 
The house will go after the players and are forced to draw another card if they are below 17 and stay otherwise. 
All bets will be made before the round begins (blind) and the there is a 1:1 payout.
